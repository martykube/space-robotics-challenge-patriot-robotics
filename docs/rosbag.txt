One nice trick to speed developement is to work against a recording of the simultor instead of the simulator.  It's way faster.

Run the simulator and record topics needed as inputs to our nodes:

rosbag record --duration=1m \
/multisense/camera/left/image_raw \
/multisense/camera/left/camera_info \
/multisense/camera/right/image_raw \
/multisense/camera/right/camera_info \
/tf \
/tf_static


Replay the bag 10 times faster than the simulation time.  When running the simulator simulation time is about 1/4 clock time on my box.  So this is 40x faster:

rosbag play -r 10 2016-12-18-11-40-28.bag

To run our nodes without the simulation use task1_nodes.launch
